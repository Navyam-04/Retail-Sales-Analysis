# üõç Retail Sales Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
**Project Title:** Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Database:** `p1_retail_db`

This project demonstrates SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to **explore, clean, and analyze** retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and answering **business-related** questions through SQL queries.

This project is ideal for **beginners** who want to **build a strong foundation in SQL** and understand how to derive business insights from data.

## üõ† Database Setup
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Creation**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Table Creation**
```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

---

## üîç Data Exploration & Cleaning
### **Record Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
```

### **Unique Customers**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
```

### **Unique Product Categories**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```

### **Check for NULL Values**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### **Delete Records with NULL Values**
```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

## üìä Data Analysis & Business Insights

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve All Sales for a Specific Date**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve All Transactions for 'Clothing' Category with Quantity > 4 in Nov 2022**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
AND quantity >= 4;
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Total Sales per Category**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Find Average Age of Customers Who Purchased 'Beauty' Products**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age FROM retail_sales WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Find Transactions with Total Sale > 1000**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Find Total Transactions by Gender in Each Category**
```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Find Best-Selling Month in Each Year**
```sql
SELECT year, month, avg_sale FROM (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS t1
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Find Top 5 Customers Based on Highest Total Sales**
```sql

```sql
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM hourly_sale GROUP BY shift;
```
